## This is the README file of the coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project.
 
The data set has been used is in the folder named "Dataset". "run_analysis.R" is the r code for analysing data and finally creating a tidy data set. In order to run the analysis, the "run_analysis.R" and "Dataset" should be in the same directory. "run_analysis.R" should be opened in RStudio and simply run there. As a result a text file as "tidy_data.txt" will be created in the same directory as the "run_analysis.R".
